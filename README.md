# SchoolList
List of schools around the Bay

`CA NV schools.csv` is a subset of all the schools listed in a Department of Education [survey](https://inventory.data.gov/dataset/856103e8-8421-4064-bfe2-bb24f16b312d/resource/6c334124-f07f-4791-9fc6-d7f95eb9e7f5). I didn't include the orinal file because it was like 100 mb, a bit to big for github.

The `.ipynb` file contains all the code needed to run generate these results, except for the map. (It's an ipython notebook and needs that to actually run.) The map needs a API token to Mapbox, which is not included here because this is a public repository. But it's free to get one.
